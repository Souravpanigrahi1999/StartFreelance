- vs code is working.
    - good evening

- Day 1 question answer?

- What is public ?
    - public is a java keyword which declares a member's access as public.
    - public members are visible to all other classes.
- Why don't we use 'private' in class main ?
    -JVM won't be able to call that main method so the code wont be executed to avoid this it will give
     you compile time error.
- How many different  ways to operate concantination ?
    - Concatenation operators join multiple strings into a single string. 
    - There are two concatenation operators, + and & . 
- Explain "public static void main".
    - Public:- it is an access specifier that means it will be accessed by publically.
    - Static:- it is access modifier that means when the java program is load then it will create the
     space in memory automatically.
    - Void:- it is a return type that is it does not return any value.
    -  main():- it is a method or a function name.
- Explain "System.out.println"
    - System: It is a final class defined in the java.lang package.
    - out: This is an instance of PrintStream type, which is a public and static member field of the System
     class.
    - println(): As all instances of PrintStream class have a public method println(). It prints any argument
     passed to it and adds a new line to the output.

- Day 2 question answer ?

- - Why Java became very poppular?
    - Some features that makes Java so useful and popular..
        - Easy to Use
            Java's syntax is similar to C & C++. The ideal language for beginning Java students who can
             master the language in two stages. It starts with Core Java and then moves on to Advanced Java.
        - Built in Security
            Java programming language uses for creating software applications, Web applications, Android
             applications, and software tools.
        - Open Source
            It is open-source, which implies that it is free to use. Any developer with a working knowledge
             of Java can use this free platform to create apps.
        - Strong Community
            It's a largest stack flow community. If there is any compillation error in the programming,
             then other programmers can assist us and solve that problem.
        - Excellent Documentation
            Its extensive documentation is well defined that provides complete guide to help and solve
             any problems we may encounter when coding in Java.
- Why Java 8 is still popular?
    - It's an LTS (Long Term Support) version, where as not all vversions of Java are LTS versions.
     This LTS version was introduced only in Java 8 (2014).
- Features or Advantages of Java 8.
    - Lambda expressions,
    - Method references,
    - Functional interfaces,
    - Stream API,
    - Default methods,
    - Base64 Encode Decode,
    - Static methods in interface,
    - Optional class,
    - Collectors class,
    - ForEach() method,
    - Nashorn JavaScript Engine,
    - Parallel Array Sorting,
    - Type and Repating Annotations,
    - IO Enhancements,
    - Concurrency Enhancements,
    - JDBC Enhancements etc.

- Day 3 question answer ?

- Class
    Class is an user defined BluePrint from which objects are created.
-Object
    It is the result of a class.
        -How many ways to create an object?
            There are five different ways to create an object in Java:
                - Java new Operator
                - Java Class.newInstance() method
                - Java newInstance() method of constructor
                - Java Object.clone() method
                - Java Object Serialization and Deserialization
- Functional Programming
    - It's an OOP concept. There are 2 methods used in functional programming.
        - Using Objects Method
        - Using Static Method
- To create an Object
        B b = new B
    - 'B' is an Object.   - 'b' is a reference of the object.
- OOPs features
    - Inheritance
        A & B are two classes, are independent to each other. B is the child class of A. Then we have
         to inherit them using 2 methods.
        - using extends keyword
        - using implements keyword
            - How to know where we can use extends keyword or implements keyword?
                When a class can inherit another class, then we use extends keyword. And when a class
                 can implement an interface, then we use implements keyword.
    - Polymorphism
        If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. There are 2 methods.
        - Overloading (Compile time Polymorphism)
        - Overriding (Run time Polymorphism)
    - Abstraction
        To hide something. There are 2 ways
        - Abstract Class
        - Interface
            - Difference between class, abstract class, interface.
                Class
                - Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.
                Abstract Class
                - Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
                Interface
                - Interface can have only abstract methods.
    - Encapsulation
        To bind the behaviour and properties.
- How many different keywords available in java?
    There are 51 keywords available in Java.
    - Access modifiers − private, protected, public.
    - Class, method, variable modifiers− abstract, class, extends, final, implements, interface, native,
     new, static, strictfp, synchronized, transient, volatile.
    - Flow control− break, case, continue, default, do, else, for, if, instanceof, return, switch, while.
    - Package control− import, package.
    - Primitive types− boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, short.
    - Error handling− assert, catch, finally, throw, throws, try.
    - Enumeration− enum.
    - Others− super, this, void.
    - Unused− const, goto.

- DAy 4 question answer ?

- Access Specifier
    The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a class.
    There are 4 types of access specifier in Java.
    - Public
    - Private
    - Default
    - Protected
- MAVEN
    It's a powerful Project Management Tool. It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.
- Monolithic
    The monolithic operating system is a very basic operating system in which file management, memory
     management, device management, and process management are directly controlled within the kernel.
      The kernel can access all the resources present in the system.
- Microservice
    Microservices are the small services that work together. It's a Service Oriented Architecture.
     By combining all the microservices, it constructs a big service. In the microservice architecture,
      all the services communicate with each other.
- Spring Boot
    It is used to create a stand-alone Spring-based application. Spring Boot is the combination of Spring
     Framework and Embedded Servers.
