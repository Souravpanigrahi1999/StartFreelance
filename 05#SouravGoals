- vs code is working.
    - good evening
- What is public ?
    - public is a java keyword which declares a member's access as public.
    - public members are visible to all other classes.
- Why don't we use 'private' in class main ?
    -JVM won't be able to call that main method so the code wont be executed to avoid this it will give you compile time error.
- How many different  ways to operate concantination ?
    - Concatenation operators join multiple strings into a single string. 
    - There are two concatenation operators, + and & . 
- Explain "public static void main".
    - Public:- it is an access specifier that means it will be accessed by publically.
    - Static:- it is access modifier that means when the java program is load then it will create the space in memory automatically.
    - Void:- it is a return type that is it does not return any value.
    -  main():- it is a method or a function name.
- Explain "System.out.println"
    - System: It is a final class defined in the java.lang package.
    - out: This is an instance of PrintStream type, which is a public and static member field of the System class.
    - println(): As all instances of PrintStream class have a public method println(). It prints any argument passed to it and adds a new line to the output.
